<p>In the summer of 2016, my family went to Key West for a vacation. Key west is one of a group of islands in the south tip of Florida State. It's one of the hottest tourist destinations in the U.S.</p>
<p>The group of islands are called Keys, which extend from the Florida peninsula. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_1">Route US-1</a> passes throught the Keys and is claimed as one of the most beautiful roads along the coast.</p>
<p>When my family arrived there, we lived in a hotel in Key West and went to the beaches, cruises, and parks. It was one of the most memorable travel for my family. The sea there is absolutely georgeous.</p>
